Android app for image localization

### Features: 
######(_italics_ = in progress)
- Clicking on "Learning" should get image and position/heading data, _and send it to server for analysis_
 - if device has no gps (like my Nexus 7), display error message
- Clicking on "Capture" should _send image to server, get response coordinates, and_ display a map of the location.


####App to-do's: (highest priority first)
- get http requests working 
- fix back button crashes (most notably, from map back to camera)
- make screen vertical without making camera turn sideways

##### In the end:
 - remove "learning" button
 - remove text that shows the direction
